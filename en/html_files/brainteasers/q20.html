<div data-index="20">🍷🧪 Suppose you stumble upon an incredible deal: you buy 1000 bottles of Château Pétrus 1945 for a ridiculously low price. Unfortunately, exactly one of the 1000 bottles is poisoned.<br><br>
You have 10 wine-lover guinea pigs (friends who claim to be wine experts but still mix up a Bordeaux and a Beaujolais). A single drop of poison kills after 24 hours. You may extract drops from each bottle without fully opening them (no waste; bottles remain intact for resale/storage).<br><br>
You have at most 24 hours to identify the poisoned bottle. What strategy do you use to find it within 24 hours? Give the procedure and explain why it works.</div>
