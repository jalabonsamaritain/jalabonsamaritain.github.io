<div data-index="19">🤯🧠 Here is a brainteaser I got in my final-round interview at Goldman Sachs:<br><br>
A particle moves on the natural numbers according to a linear law, with initial position \(x_0 \in \mathbb{N}^{*}\) and constant velocity \(v \in \mathbb{N}^{*}\), both unknown.<br><br>
At each time step \(t = 1, 2, 3, \dots\), you may ask a single question of the form: <em>“Is the particle at position \(k\) ?”</em> where \(k \in \mathbb{N}^{*}\) is chosen by you. The answer is always only “Yes” or “No”. You receive no other information.<br><br>
Design a questioning strategy that will allow you to recover, in a finite number of steps, the exact values of \(x_0\) and \(v\). Prove the convergence of your strategy.</div>
