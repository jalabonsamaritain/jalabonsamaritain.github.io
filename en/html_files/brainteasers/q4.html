<div data-index="4">📈🧙‍♂️ Suppose the function \( z \mapsto f(z) \) takes complex values on the complex plane. Suppose also that \( f \) is both bounded and entire. Prove that \( f \) must be constant.<br><br>
<em>Reminder:<br>An “entire” function is analytic on the whole finite complex plane. Thus, \(f\) can be represented by a power series converging everywhere: \( f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n z^n \).</em></div>
